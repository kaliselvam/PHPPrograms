<p>Everyone loves chips

One thing we all agree on when it comes to chips is that no one can stop at one.  A simple potato, cut into batons and deep-fried. Served alone, chips are the second most popular convenience food product after sandwiches, but it’s as a faithful and indispensable side dish where chips have become so popular. Over seventy percent of Sizzler customers order chips with their grill meals!
About a chip
For children, chips are the ultimate pacifier. They were the first grown-up food that our small fingers could hold. Fortunately (or not!) chips are one of the easiest foods to share. Crisp on the outside, soft in the centre with a salty tang, they’re one of the world’s strongest cravings. Serve a bowl of fresh, hot, golden chips in to a noisy group of people and a smug silence will follow almost immediately (except for soft blowing as they cool the chips down before eating).
Who invented the chip?
The Belgians lay claim to have invented the chip or “frite” in the 1600’s. They became known as “French Fries” in the early 1900’s when British and American soldiers were introduced to them by the Belgians (French was the official language of the Belgian army). The French, the Spanish and the English have also laid claim to have invented the chip, however there is no doubt that French Fries have been popularised worldwide by the US fast food chains.
The perfect chip
The perfect chip is cut from a starchy potato, such as the Sebago or Russet Burbank, washed to reduce the surface starch, dried and either blanched or cooked in fresh oil at 163ºC to cook the potato through. It is then cooled and recooked at 188ºC to crisp and give it its golden colour. It should then be immediately salted to remove surface moisture and retain crispness – and served fresh and hot.
Chip varieties
There are now many varieties of chip including; “thick cut” “shoestring”: “crinkle”, “curly”, “waffle cut”, “skin on”, “wedges” and “oven fries” to name a few. And chips are served with a wide variety of “traditional dishes” depending on your origins…
